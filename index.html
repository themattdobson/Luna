        <h2>Once upon a time there was a girl named Luna. <br>She really loved the Moon.</h2>

        <p>One day her aunt asked her if she wanted to come to the space center because she worked there. So she said yes. They were working on a space trip to the Moon. She was really excited to see the rocket.</p>

        <p>When she got there she saw the rocket. She was amazed. She wanted to go in the rocket. Her aunt said no but, she went anyway. She went up the staircase. She went into the rocket. Her aunt went after her, but she was too fast. Her aunt yelled, “Luna, Stop!” but Luna would not stop. When her aunt caught up to her she was in the rocket.</p>
  </div>

      <div class="rocket">

      <img src="images/rocket2.png" class="img-fluid" data-aos="fade-up-right"
      data-aos="fade-up"
      data-aos-offset="0"
      data-aos-delay="100"
      data-aos-duration="1500"
      data-aos-easing="ease-in-out"
      data-aos-mirror="true"
      data-aos-once="false"
      data-aos-anchor-placement="top-center"
 alt="" />

      </div>


      <p>The aunt got in the rocket and said, “Luna, get out this instant!” but Luna said “No!” Luna accidentally pressed the launch button and the aunt said, “now we go to the Moon!” The aunt said, “okay put your space suit on.” “Okay,” said Luna and it counted down. </p>

      <h2>5-4-3-2-1 Blast off!</h2>

      <div class="blackhole">
         <div class="spinner">
        <img src="images/blackhole.png" class="img-fluid">
      </div>
      </div>

      <p>They went into space. Luna said, “where are we going? We are going, we are going to the Moon!” “What are we doing on the Moon?” asked Luna. “We are exploring the Moon for living life on it” said her aunt. Luna said, “Fun! I love it. It will be fun. I love the Moon!” Said Luna.</p>

      <p>Luna saw many cool things. She saw a black hole. She said she loved it so much. She even made up a song about the Moon. <em>“I love the Moon so much!”</em></p>

      <p>She was almost at the Moon. Her aunt said, “you can go on the Moon for 10 minutes.” They landed on the Moon! They got off the rocket and went down to the Moon. They explored for 5 minutes. Then Luna saw something green moving around. She looked at it and it moved. It was an alien!</p>

      <p>The Alien was very nice. They got along very well. They made friends. They saw something, it looked like an asteroid. She needed something to stop it. The alien forgot to show her something. It was his secret lair. </p>

      <div class="alien">
         <div class="animated infinite bounce slower" >
        <img src="images/people.png" class="img-fluid">
      </div>
      </div>


      <p>They went to the secret lair. The aunt said, “Whoa!” It was so cool. She loved it so much. They looked around for something to stop the meteor. They found a really big net. They got it all ready. It was almost time for the meteor to hit Earth. They needed to get ready. Because if they save the Earth they needed a plan. So they were going to fly in the rocket ship then she would cover up the meteor. Then go back to earth. So the time had come to save Earth. </p>

      <p>So they went in the rocketship and everyone was cheering for Luna. The meteor was almost to Earth. 5 minutes later they caught it. </p>

      <div data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-delay="0" data-aos-duration="1000"
    data-aos-easing="ease-in-out">
<img src="images/net.png" class="img-fluid" alt="" /></div>

      <p>They spent a little time in the aliens lair. The alien said, “Please do not tell everyone I was real.” Luna did not. They went back to earth and everyone called her the girl in the moon. </p>

      <p>20 years later she worked at Nasa Space Center. She got asked to go on a real mission to Mars. She went to Mars two months after that. She had two kids Rose and Solar. They loved space too. Luna put up a picture and it had her on the moon. Her old friend the alien sent her funny photos of him every day. She wrote a book about it. It was called, LUNA, the girl in the moon.</p>
